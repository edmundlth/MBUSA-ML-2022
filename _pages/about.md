This site collects extra materials used by the Machine Learning module in the Master of Business Analytics course at Melbourne Business School (MBS). 
Due to copyright reason, course materials won't be directly posted to this site, but I will attempt to capture a good summary of the topics discussed in class. 
If you are a student of the course, feel free to ask questions by commenting on each post and I will try to answer. If I take too long to reply (or I just missed it), perhaps emailing me might still be the better option. 

This site is generated by [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), which is a blogging platform that natively support Jupyter notebooks.
